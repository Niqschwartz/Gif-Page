# Gif-Page

I was having more trouble with this one then I thought I would. I got help from a tutor and it made much more sense.

I had made all of my buttons on my HTML page, but I realized I needed to make them dynamically on my js page.

I was also having trouble with the still/animate feature. I was trying to manipulte the queryURL after it was searched, but what I needed to do was change it before the search. (Does that make sense?)

The tutoring session helped immensly, and I will definitely be using the service again.
